Layout using GRID

	there are ROWS and COLUMNS

	* We can define no. of rows and columns and their dimensions
		*Dimensions can be either Manually typed, Auto keyword or * keyword
			* if we set * in Height = "*" in all columns, they will divide the rows/columns in grid equally
			* if add a coefficient to * like 4* the ratio will be 1:4:1:1.....
			
			* Or give manually Height = "100px" etc.

			* Or give "auto" by Height = "auto"
	* we can add Stack Panels inside Grid components
